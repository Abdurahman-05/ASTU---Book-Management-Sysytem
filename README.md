Welcome to Our Library Book Management System!!
Our System built on intention of Solving a problem that found in library when student want to borrow book the librariest work manually,
therefore we want to solve this problem by making it digital or by digitalizing the borrow/return process for the Librariyst
This system is biult mainly for libraryist(only libraryist are the user)
This system has some draw back 
    1. If new book were to added or old book to be deleted we have to add/delete it on the database by the database system opretor librayist cannot add book or delete
    2. This system cannot show history of borrowed book that returned, ofcorse we can view it on the database by the opretor
    3. There is only one user known as 'admin' whose password is'123'
This system has also some feature
    1.We can view books that is aviliable for borrow or that are in the library 
    2.We can borrow books
    3.We can view borrowed book inforamtion inlcuding who borrowed them and also we can select one at time and return them to the library
If we want to use this system we have to clone this repo and use 'full-stack' directory, all front and back end we integrated in that directory
